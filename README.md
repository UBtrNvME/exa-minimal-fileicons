<h4 align='center'>A minimal fileicons inspired by exa</h4>
<br>

*This theme was build based on the way [exa - a modern replacement for ls](https://github.com/ogham/exa#readme) renders icons.*

## Examples:
![example1](images/example1.png)

## Roadmap:
* replace static fileicons map with a script that will generate them on the fly
* generate colors depending on the backgound color
